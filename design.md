#  Design Document

## 1. Overview

This project applies Echo State Networks to forecast weather-like patterns using real-world time series data.
It builds on a previous Lorenz-96 experiment and extends it to evaluate model performance on real atmospheric measurements.

## 2. Goals

- Apply ESN to forecast weather-like patterns using real-world time series data

## 8. Timeline & Milestones

chatgpt says
**Week 1â€“3: Foundations**
- Read papers and docs on:
  - Echo State Networks (ESNs)
  - NeuralGCM and Dinosaur
  - ERA5 reanalysis dataset
  - Xarray and UV project setup
- Set up GitHub repo, virtual environment, and project structure
- Begin collecting notes and questions in the design doc

**Week 4-5: Reproduction & Exploration**
- Try to replicate simplified experiments from NeuralGCM or Dinosaur
- Load and explore weather datasets (e.g., ERA5 samples or toy data)

**Week 6-7: Code Migration & Baseline Evaluation**
- Migrate code from original Lorenz-96 or previous ESN project
- Build minimal PDE simulator (e.g., Lorenz-96) in a reusable module
- Create an evaluation script to test baseline models:
  - Constant predictor
  - Linear/persistence predictor
- Use these simple models to establish weak baselines
- Compare predictions to simulated trajectories using RMSE or MAE

**Week 7+: Modeling and Evaluation**
- Train and test ESN on simulated data
- Compare to baselines (GRU, etc.)
- Analyze long-term vs. short-term prediction accuracy
- Document results and insights
- Train and test ESN on real-world data (ERA5)

## 9. Open Questions

- Is it the size of the data or the size of the model that is the limiting factor for long-term predictions?
- Is it useful to have a model that can make short-term predictions more efficiently than what's currently used?
